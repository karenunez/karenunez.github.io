I did my master at IPICYT in San Luis Potosí, México. There I focused on gene regulation of mate genes in C. glabrata.

In my PhD I build a model of the differentiation of human monocytes in special dendritic cell outcome.

Now I am interest in tolerogenic dendritic cells in Lupus disease and their differences with healthy controls.

I am co-organizaer of R-ladies Querétaro.

I also enjoy been a menthor for high school girls interested in STEM area.
